# cs2-kernel-esp
Utilizes a kernel driver for memory reading and external DirectX overlay rendering, enabling visual overlays that can display additional player information in CS2.

## Note
This was a learning project, and as a result, I will not be maintaining it. The external overlay it creates will be detected by VAC. However, VAC does not have any checks against hijacked overlays. For example, you could hijack the Nvidia overlay, but it is not the only overlay you could hijack. There are many other things you could use, and you can edit the code to do so.
